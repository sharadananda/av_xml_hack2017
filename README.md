ML Hackathon 2017 organised by Analyticsvidhya and sponsored by Aigues de Barcelona

My approach:
I put lot of effort on data cleaning and combining datasets. In the process, I simply ignored simple facts like focussing
on the requirements.
The requirements were very clearly written, predict contacts based on contract type and predict resolutions based on 
subject and category. Next obvious steps is to look for the train and test data sets. 
I deviated here and directed all my efforts on how to combine additional datasets like census & contracts.
XGB can be used in Python as well as R. I should have tried XGB with R for better scores.

I worked on a ML solution, provided by @akashgupta222 and tried tweaking it for better scores.

But I learned a lot, the importance of validation set & thinking out of box are one of the important lessons.
